Website for Lightning Payments

This is a very VERY early demo website for our company "Lightning Payments." 
The main purpose of this website is show our website plan, and indicate
the bare-bones features we want it to have, such as balance history and a
place to link payment methods/cards to an account. Right now, we simply have
two pages for each functionality, one that shows it blank, and one that shows
it populated with semi-realistic data.
The main point of this website at the moment is the About page. It is what
provides data on who we are and what we do. If you are curious, go give it
a read!
