        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <br>
        <p>We strive to create a world where people can make point of sale transactions without having to <br>
            fumble around with physical objects such as cash, cards and cell phones.<br><br><br></p>
        <p>We are working towards two key goals:<br><br></p>

        <p>1. Reduce the need for merchants to hand out physical change <br>
            and for consumers to have to carry loose change with them.<br><br></p>
        <p>2. Eliminate the need for a traditional wallet or a phone, in <br>
            that anyone can make a transaction at any time using simply <br>
            their biometric identity.<br><br><br></p>

        <p>Secure biometric-authorized payments are the future, and we want to make the future safe and <br>
            easy for you to operate. Eventually larger corporations may enter this space, but we want to <br>
            make it so that your privacy is the top priority, not profits.<br><br></p>

        <br><br><br>
        <h1>What we do</h1>
        <br>
            <p>We build biometric payment terminals that utilize facial and fingerprint recognition technology <br>
            to authorize transactions.<br><br></p> 

            <p>Using our terminals, people can opt to transfer any physical change that they receive on cash <br>
            transactions in the form of a cash balance. This balance can then be used on future transactions.<br><br></p>
            
            <p>Most Importantly, our terminals allow people to link their preferred credit and debit cards as <br>
            well as any bank accounts to our online system during registration. In this way, people can make <br>
            transactions using any payment method on the go without carrying around any sort of wallet.<br><br>
            </p>
