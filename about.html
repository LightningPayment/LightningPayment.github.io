        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <br>
        <p>We strive to create a world where people can make point of sale transactions without having to <br>
            fumble around with physical objects such as cash, cards and cell phones.<br><br><br></p>
        <p>We are working towards two key goals:<br><br></p>

        <p>1. Reduce the need for merchants to hand out physical change <br>
            and for consumers to have to carry loose change with them.<br><br></p>
        <p>2. Eliminate the need for a traditional wallet or a phone, in <br>
            that anyone can make a transaction at any time using simply <br>
            their biometric identity.<br><br><br></p>

        <p>Secure biometric-authorized payments are the future, and we want to make the future safe and <br>
            easy for you to operate. Eventually larger corporations may enter this space, but we want to <br>
            make it so that your privacy is the top priority, not profits.<br><br></p>

        <br><br><br>
        <h1>What We Do</h1>
        <br>
            <p>We build biometric payment terminals that utilize facial and fingerprint recognition technology <br>
            to authorize transactions.<br><br></p> 

            <p>Using our terminals, people can opt to transfer any physical change that they receive on cash <br>
            transactions in the form of a cash balance. This balance can then be used on future transactions.<br><br></p>
            
            <p>Most Importantly, our terminals allow people to link their preferred credit and debit cards as <br>
            well as any bank accounts to our online system during registration. In this way, people can make <br>
            transactions using any payment method on the go without carrying around any sort of wallet.<br><br>
            </p>

        <h1>Meet The Founders</h1>
        <br>
            <p>Hello! I’m Aditya Kurkut! I am a computer science major at UC Davis, and the cofounder, CEO<br>
            at Lightning Payments. After experiencing inconveniences in the way modern payments were being<br>
            processed, I was inspired to build the initial prototype of our biometric terminal! In my free<br>
            time, I love to tinker with hardware and build gadgets using development boards such as Arduino<br>
            and Raspberry Pi. Currently, I am learning ROS and also lead the Davis Robotics Club at UC Davis!<br></p>
        <br><br>
            <p>Hi, I’m Sage Zimmerman! I am a computer Science Major at UC Davis, and the cofounder, CTO <br>
            at Lightning Payments. I designed this website! I originally got into coding to make games.<br>
             I have yet to make a game, but there’s plenty of other stuff I can do in the meantime. Just<br>
             like this!</p>

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>“But what if someone takes a picture of my face or gets my prints and steals my money?”</h3>
            <p>Well, that’s actually easier said than done, since facial recognition technology usually <br>
            requires a 3D figure with a certain degree of height and depth as opposed to that of a 2D <br>
            image! However, in the event that someone was able to take a 3D mold of your face and <br>
            use it to steal your money, they would also require your PIN in order to make any <br>
            purchases. Given this, our biometric identification system is less dangerous than <br>
            getting your card stolen.<br></p>
            <br>
            <h3>“Isn’t linking people’s biometric data to their bank accounts kind of dangerous?”</h3>
            <p>We don’t sell your data to anyone. Not the government, not to data brokers, not to private <br>
            individuals or companies. The only thing we use it for is to authenticate your identity <br>
            when you make purchases. All your information is encrypted, so in the event someone illegally <br>
            broke into our servers and took your info, it would not be readable, and couldn’t be linked <br>
            back to you.<br></p>
            <br>
            <h3>“Is your goal to move us to a cashless society?”</h3>
            <p>No. This is not our goal at all. This is just a tool for people who feel extremely awkward <br>
            holding up a line while they fumble for their wallet in trying to look for their cards or change.<br></p>
            <br>
            <h3>“What if I don’t feel comfortable having a camera pointed at my face while <br>
            I’m paying for things?”</h3>
            <p>We are planning to have an agreement with stores using our products that our terminal <br>
            is only to be pointed at you after you consent to using our product. The biometric <br>
            scanner would only be presented to you with your permission, and only then would you be <br>
            able to access your account. We do not keep records of your Biometric ID when you make purchases.<br>
            We only know the amount you spent so that you can make sure your account is secure and not being <br>
            maliciously misused. We only keep the scans you use to register your account with for reverse <br>
            authentication (your data is encrypted, of course).<br></p>
